Part 5 - Certification Project - Build a Survey Form

I am an aspiring student-leader in my school, and we need to collect questions from our fellow Electronics Engineering students. This is not the official survey form that we used for collecting questions though. I just take the opportunity to relate our current needs to my certification project. Credits to our Head Election Officer for doing the official form used to gather data, as I used the content for this Survey Form. :)
