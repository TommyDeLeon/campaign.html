# 📝 Project Documentation: Crafting a Survey Form for Electronics Engineering Students 🎓

Welcome to Part 5 of our journey! As an aspiring student-leader, I saw the need to collect questions from my fellow Electronics Engineering students. This project, while not the official survey form, is a testament to that need. It's a tribute to our Head Election Officer who created the official form. Let's dive into the creation of this survey form! 😊

## 🛠️ Technology Used
This project is a beautiful blend of **HTML** and **CSS**. HTML is our foundation, structuring the content of the webpage, while CSS is our artist, styling the webpage to perfection.

## 🎓 Lessons Learned
This project was a deep dive into the world of forms and CSS styling. We learned how to:
- Create a registration form using HTML and style it using CSS 📝
- Use different types of input fields (text, email, password, radio, checkbox, file, number, select, and textarea) 🖊️
- Make certain fields required and use the pattern attribute to enforce specific input patterns 🔒
- Style the form and its elements using CSS, including how to use the :last-of-type pseudo-class and style specific types of input fields 🎨

## 🎨 What Was Created
We crafted a registration form that includes fields for the user's first name, last name, email, password, account type, agreement to the terms and conditions, profile picture, age, referrer, and bio. The form is styled with a sleek dark theme.

## 💡 Ideas to Make It Better
### Form validation:
Our form is currently silent. Adding form validation with JavaScript would make it more communicative, providing feedback to the user if they enter invalid data. 📣
### Responsiveness:
Let's make our form more adaptable to different screen sizes. Currently, it has a fixed width in viewport units, which may not look good on all screen sizes. 📱
### Accessibility:
Let's ensure our form is accessible to all users. This could include adding more descriptive labels and instructions, ensuring sufficient color contrast, and adding ARIA attributes where necessary. 🌐

## 📸 Visuals
Feast your eyes on some screenshots of our sleek registration form:

I'm thrilled to share that when you hover over the submit button, it has a transition effect that completely fills the button within 0.5 seconds. It's the little details that count! 😊

(Note: The web page scales content to 80% of its original size to ensure full visibility within the viewport.)
